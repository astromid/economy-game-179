## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . run --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```

For running tests on your local machine.

1. you need to start a database.

    I prefer doing it with docker:

    ```bash
    docker run -p "3306:3306" -e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=egame179_backend" -e "MYSQL_USER=egame179_backend" -e "MYSQL_DATABASE=egame179_backend" -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes bitnami/mysql:8.0.26
    ```

2. Run the pytest.

    ```bash
    pytest -vv .
    ```
